Welcome to my daily progress repository where I document my journey of learning **Full-Stack Web Development** from scratch â€” starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and going all the way to Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React (MERN stack).

 ðŸ§­ Goal

To become a proficient full-stack developer by consistently learning and building projects over the next few months.

 ðŸ“… Daily Progress

I will be updating this repository **daily or weekly** with:
- Code snippets
- Mini projects or practice assignments

- Each folder will represent a day.
